I saw a few projects like this one and I've decided to make my own.

The "Graph Algorithms Visualizer" is exactly how it sounds like,

Web application for visualizing graph search algorithms such as BFS, DFS and Dijkstra. with maze generation algorithms such as Prim, Kruskal, etc.


## Maze Generation

Capable of generating mazes using algorithms such as Kruskal's, Prim's, DFS and Random

## Path Finding

Using BFS, DFS or Dijkstra, this web application animates the proccess in a fun way and of course, showing the path afterwards.

## TODO

Add an option to give the user the freedom to move the start and end points anywhere.
